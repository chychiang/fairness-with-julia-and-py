    "- One of the examples of algorithmic bias is the famous case of amazon's AI recruiting tool biasing against women. Amazon, like many big tech companies, has been using automated tools to recruit top talents from the huge pool of candidates that they receive applications from. In an ideal situation, all candidates will be judged fairly based off their abilities.\n",
    "- However, in 2015, Amazon discovered that its hiring algorithm for software developers are heavily biased against women. \n",
    "- This is because the machine learning algorithm were trained to observe pattern from previous successful hires and most of these data points come from men.\n",

    "- Developed by IBM's research team Trusted AI, it is an opensource toolkit for examining, reporting, and mitigating discrimination and bias in machine learning models.\n",

    "- Using the package, we can load common datasets such as the Adult Census Income Dataset, Bank marketing Dataset, German credit Dataset, etc.\n",
    "- The package splits the algorithms into 3 main types:\n",
    "    1. Preprocessing: modifying the dataset before training\n",
    "    2. Inprocessing: modifying the training process to ensure fairness\n",
    "    3. Postprocessing: calibrate, reject, or equalize outcomes after training has been done\n",
    "- In this example, I will only demonstrate a few examples of the functionality that it provides. To learn more, go to https://aif360.mybluemix.net/data for an interactive demo\n",
